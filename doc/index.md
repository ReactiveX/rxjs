**The ReactiveX library for JavaScript.**

RxJS is a library for reactive programming using Observables, to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code. This project is a rewrite of [Reactive-Extensions/RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) with better performance, better modularity, better debuggable call stacks, while staying mostly backwards compatible, with some breaking changes that reduce the API surface.
