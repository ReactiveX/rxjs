 * A process embodying the general "merge" strategy. This is used in

 * @param source The original source observable
 * @param subscriber The consumer subscriber
 * @param project The projection function to get our inner sources
 * @param concurrent The number of concurrent inner subscriptions
 * @param onBeforeNext Additional logic to apply before nexting to our consumer
 * @param expand If `true` this will perform an "expand" strategy, which differs only
 * in that it recurses, and the inner subscription must be schedule-able.
 * @param innerSubScheduler A scheduler to use to schedule inner subscriptions,
 * this is to support the expand strategy, mostly, and should be deprecated
