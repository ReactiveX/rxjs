/**
 * Emits a notification from the source Observable only after a particular time span
 * determined by another Observable has passed without another source emission.
 *
 * <span class="informal">It's like {@link debounceTime}, but the time span of
 * emission silence is determined by a second Observable.</span>
 *
 * ![](debounce.svg)
 *
 * `debounce` delays notifications emitted by the source Observable, but drops previous
 * pending delayed emissions if a new notification arrives on the source Observable.
 * This operator keeps track of the most recent notification from the source
 * Observable, and spawns a duration Observable by calling the
 * `durationSelector` function. The notification is emitted only when the duration
 * Observable emits a next notification, and if no other notification was emitted on
 * the source Observable since the duration Observable was spawned. If a new
 * notification appears before the duration Observable emits, the previous notification will
 * not be emitted and a new duration is scheduled from `durationSelector` is scheduled.
 * If the completing event happens during the scheduled duration the last cached notification
 * is emitted before the completion event is forwarded to the output observable.
 * If the error event happens during the scheduled duration or after it only the error event is
 * forwarded to the output observable. The cache notification is not emitted in this case.
 *
 * Like {@link debounceTime}, this is a rate-limiting operator, and also a
 * delay-like operator since output emissions do not necessarily occur at the
 * same time as they did on the source Observable.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * Emit the most recent click after a burst of clicks
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { fromEvent, scan, debounce, interval } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * const result = clicks.pipe(
 *   scan(i => ++i, 1),
 *   debounce(i => interval(200 * i))
 * );
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 * ```

 * @param durationSelector A function

 * duration for each source value, returned as an Observable or a Promise.
 * @return A function that returns an Observable that delays the emissions of
 * the source Observable by the specified duration Observable returned by
 * `durationSelector`, and may drop some values if they occur too frequently.
