/**
 * Waits for the source to complete, then emits the last N values from the source,
 * as specified by the `count` argument.
 *
 * ![](takeLast.png)
 *
 * `takeLast` results in an observable that will hold values up to `count` values in memory,
 * until the source completes. It then pushes all values in memory to the consumer, in the
 * order they were received from the source, then notifies the consumer that it is
 * complete.
 *
 * If for some reason the source completes before the `count` supplied to `takeLast` is reached,
 * all values received until that point are emitted, and then completion is notified.
 *
 * **Warning**: Using `takeLast` with an observable that never completes will result
 * in an observable that never emits a value.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * Take the last 3 values of an Observable with many values
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { range, takeLast } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * const many = range(1, 100);
 * const lastThree = many.pipe(takeLast(3));
 * lastThree.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link take}
 * @see {@link takeUntil}
 * @see {@link takeWhile}
 * @see {@link skip}
 *
 * @param count The maximum number of values to emit from the end of
 * the sequence of values emitted by the source Observable.
 * @return A function that returns an Observable that emits at most the last
 * `count` values emitted by the source Observable.
