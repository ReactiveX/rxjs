/**
 * Branch out the source Observable values as a nested Observable with each
 * nested Observable emitting at most `windowSize` values.
 *
 * <span class="informal">It's like {@link bufferCount}, but emits a nested
 * Observable instead of an array.</span>
 *
 * ![](windowCount.png)
 *
 * Returns an Observable that emits windows of items it collects from the source
 * Observable. The output Observable emits windows every `startWindowEvery`
 * items, each containing no more than `windowSize` items. When the source
 * Observable completes or encounters an error, the output Observable emits
 * the current window and propagates the notification from the source
 * Observable. If `startWindowEvery` is not provided, then new windows are
 * started immediately at the start of the source and when each window completes
 * with size `windowSize`.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * Ignore every 3rd click event, starting from the first one
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { fromEvent, windowCount, map, skip, mergeAll } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * const result = clicks.pipe(
 *   windowCount(3),
 *   map(win => win.pipe(skip(1))), // skip first of every 3 clicks
 *   mergeAll()                     // flatten the Observable-of-Observables
 * );
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 * ```
 *
 * Ignore every 3rd click event, starting from the third one
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { fromEvent, windowCount, mergeAll } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');
 * const result = clicks.pipe(
 *   windowCount(2, 3),
 *   mergeAll() // flatten the Observable-of-Observables
 * );
 * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
 * ```

 *
 * @param windowSize The maximum number of values emitted by each window.
 * @param startWindowEvery Interval at which to start a new window. For example
 * if `startWindowEvery` is `2`, then a new window will be started on every
 * other value from the source. A new window is started at the beginning of the
 * source by default.
 * @return A function that returns an Observable of windows, which in turn are
 * Observable of values.
